# Extensive EDA - Google Playstore Apps

This repo contains an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) performed on a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) on Kaggle

## Introduction

The Google Play Store, with over 3.5 million apps, is a dynamic hub of innovation. This notebook is inspired by Dr. Ammar Tufail's [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/3KMq1JT2uKg?si=8g2fDvNMq_qTlKyb), I conduct an in-depth analysis, enhancing and innovating upon his methodologies. I meticulously clean and dissect the dataset, exploring trends and revealing narratives behind app success and developer challenges.

Adopting specific methodologies from Dr. Ammar's tutorial, I removed the anamolous column he identified and I refine columns like Reviews, Size, and Installs. I took the cleaning process further by cleaning the categorical column; Genre. And drove the analysis on my own. Rather than mere reproduction, my goal is to enhance, expand, and innovate, revealing new insights along the way. So this notebook goes beyond number-crunching, offering insights into the dynamic world of Google Play Store apps through concise visualizations and tables.

Whether you're a data enthusiast, app developer, or curious user, join me on this expedition into the heart of the Play Store. Let's unravel the secrets hidden in the bytes and pixels, forging our own path in this fascinating, data-driven landscape.
